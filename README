ACL
---------------

ACL is actually two parts. It consists of a controller and action based access control system, where users have roles,
and roles have permissions, which are a controller and a comma delimited set of actions.

The other part is implicit scoping of ActiveRecord finders, so users can only see what they have access to.

So, for example, Post.find(:all) when a user is logged in can automatically limit to what the finders return.
The limiting criteria is defined in the model, so it's defined in one place, but applies anywhere.

NOTE: Currently in a very broken form. Does not actually work without servere tinkering. Deadlines comes first, refactoring comes later.
